/******* Arbiter object
 * The job of the arbiter is to rule whether moves are legal or not on a board,
 * to set up the initial position, to decide whether a game is over or not,
 * and to give instructions on making of special moves.
 * A special move is a move that requires two or more pieces to move (e.g. castling),
 * that requires removal of seemingly unrelated pieces (e.g. en-passant), that changes
 * a piece (e.g. promotion), or anything that is not just moving a piece to a square and capturing there.
