Trying to maybe build an online chess server...

The chess server is currently live and is playable on: http://desolate-stream-58062.herokuapp.com/

As of right now that server doesn't do anything or notifies you when the game ends, and only possible promotion is queen promotion.
If your opponent disconnects you will be replaced into the player queue though, so there's that (you won't be notified about it though).
